Wallet Credit Score Analysis
This document provides an analysis of the credit scores assigned to DeFi wallets based on their historical transaction behavior on the Aave V2 protocol. The scores range from 0 to 1000, with higher scores indicating more reliable and responsible usage.

Score Distribution
The hist_credit_scores.png generated by run_scoring.py provides a visual representation of the credit score distribution across all analyzed wallets.

Observations from the Histogram:

Central Tendency: (Describe where the majority of scores fall, e.g., "The distribution appears to be skewed towards higher scores, with a significant concentration of wallets scoring between 600 and 800.")

Lower Scores (0-300): (Comment on the frequency of very low scores, e.g., "A smaller number of wallets fall into the very low score ranges (0-300). This suggests that highly risky or inactive behavior is less common, or that our current scoring model heavily penalizes such behavior.")

Higher Scores (700-1000): (Comment on the frequency of very high scores, e.g., "There's a notable peak in the 700-900 range, indicating a substantial number of wallets exhibiting highly responsible and engaged behavior.")

Outliers/Extremes: (Note any unusual peaks or long tails, e.g., "Few wallets achieve the absolute maximum score of 1000, implying that achieving perfect scores requires exceptional activity across all positive metrics.")

Behavior of Wallets in Lower Score Ranges (e.g., 0-400)
Wallets with lower credit scores typically exhibit characteristics that our model identifies as less reliable or potentially risky. Based on our scoring logic, these might include:

Low Activity: Wallets with very few transactions (num_tx is low) or active on very few unique days (unique_days is low). These could be dormant wallets, new wallets with minimal interaction, or wallets used for single, isolated transactions.

High Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio: Wallets that borrow significantly more than they deposit, or have very little deposit activity but substantial borrowing. This suggests higher leverage or a strategy focused purely on borrowing without substantial collateral, which could be riskier.

Limited Deposits: Wallets with low total_deposited amounts, indicating less commitment or capital within the protocol.

Potential for Bot-like/Exploitative Behavior: While our current model doesn't explicitly detect bots, wallets with extremely low scores due to, for instance, very high borrow ratios or minimal engagement might warrant further investigation for unusual patterns that could indicate exploitative strategies.

Behavior of Wallets in Higher Score Ranges (e.g., 600-1000)
Wallets with higher credit scores demonstrate behaviors consistent with reliable and responsible protocol usage:

Significant Deposits: Wallets with high total_deposited amounts, indicating substantial capital committed to the Aave V2 protocol. This suggests trust and long-term engagement.

Consistent Engagement: Wallets active over many unique days (unique_days is high) and with a large number of transactions (num_tx is high). This implies regular and sustained interaction, which is a positive signal.

Balanced Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio: Wallets with a low or moderate borrow_deposit_ratio. This indicates that if they borrow, they also maintain a healthy level of deposits, suggesting responsible leverage management.

Active and Diverse Interaction: High-scoring wallets are likely to engage in a variety of actions (deposits, borrows, repays) in a consistent and financially sound manner.

Conclusion and Future Work
This credit scoring model provides a foundational framework for assessing DeFi wallet reliability based on on-chain behavior. The current scoring logic is interpretable and highlights key features.

Potential Improvements and Further Analysis:

Advanced Feature Engineering:

Incorporate time-series analysis of deposits/borrows (e.g., average daily deposit, volatility of balances).

Analyze repayment behavior (e.g., frequency of repayments, timely repayments, liquidation history).

Consider the types of assets deposited/borrowed (e.g., stablecoins vs. volatile assets).

Include external data, such as wallet age, transaction history on other protocols, or social metrics (if available and relevant).

Machine Learning Model: Instead of a rule-based scoring system, train a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model if labeled data (e.g., "good" vs. "bad" wallets) becomes available. This could capture more complex relationships between features.

Dynamic Scoring: Implement a system where scores update dynamically as new transactions occur.

Risk Segmentation: Define specific score ranges that correspond to different risk segments (e.g., "Low Risk," "Medium Risk," "High Risk") and analyze the distinct behaviors within each segment.

Explainability: Further enhance the explainability of individual scores, perhaps by showing which features contributed most positively or negatively to a wallet's final score.
